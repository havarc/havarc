Hi, I’m @havarc, tech support guy and general purpose programmer.

Currently looking for a job, preferably remote, 30h, can program anything from C on microcontroller to Javascript (see Demo-Project).

Will clean, rewrite and document any legacy project you have laying around.

Languages I like: Javascript (see Showcase), python, Ruby, C/C++, (I really should get into rust!)

Languages I'm allergic to: Java and anything Microsoft has ever touched
